# You must know that the script doesn't provide a background, though.
#
# You can also make an animated selector: you only have to make each graphic
# to contain all its corresponding animation frames in horizontal.
#
# Note: Take in mind that after calling this script the player will lose all the
# items, Pokémon and pokédex, if they previously had any. Aka: a reset.
# So make sure you call it at the very start of your game.
