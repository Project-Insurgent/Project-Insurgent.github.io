			<h2 style="text-decoration: underline; color: black;">GAME SINPOSIS:</h2>

			<p style="color: black;">The origin of the universe. Still, a great, unsolved mystery. How was it created? Who created it? And why? This is one of the few points where science and religions... still meet.</p><br>


			<p style="color: black;">The story begins thirteen years after Platinum events take place. Although you and your rival both are fourteen years old, neither of you is a trainer yet. And to solve that you will go to next city's annual trainer festival, in which you will be able to obtain your first partner! As you will check yourself soon, there are new cities and towns, routes, and even a different path around the island. A new, young professor -that you might know very well- will be the one that gives you the starters.</p>

			<p style="color: black;">But while you are having fun in the festival, a strange, huge, and terrible phenomenom is currently happening in another region, which unprecedent scale will eventually affect all the other regions in the world. Under this scenario a new team galactic, that already was aware of this (natural?) disaster is reassembled. Grunts with new outfits and hairstyles, and mainly new executives and commanders will constitute this new organization with one goal: Bringing back Cyrus.</p>
