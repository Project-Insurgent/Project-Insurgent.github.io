			<h2 style="text-decoration: underline; color: black;">GAME SINPOSIS:</h2>

			<p style="color: black;">The origin of the universe. Still, a great, unsolved mystery. How was it created? Who created it? And why? This is one of the few points where science and religions... still meet.</p><br>

			<p style="color: black;">The events of Pokémon Uprising unfold thirteen years after the events of Pokémon Platinum. Although you and your cousin are both fourteen years old, neither of you is a trainer yet, which is unusual in a region like Sinnoh. To become a trainer, this year, you two go to the annual trainer festival in Amberia City, a city near your home town. During the festival you will be able to obtain your first Pokémon! As you will see yourself, there are new cities and towns, routes, and even a different path around the island. A new, young professor —that you might know very well— will be the one that gives you the starters.</p>

			<p style="color: black;">But while you are having fun in the festival, a strange, huge, and terrible phenomenon is currently happening in the region of Alola, an unprecedent scaled event that will eventually affect all other regions in the world. Adding to this dystopian atmosphere, the old criminal organization known as Team Galactic has reassembled. Grunts with new outfits and hairstyles, and mainly new executives and commanders will constitute this new organisation with one goal: Bringing back their former boss: Cyrus.</p>
